# Part 2 - Exercises

1. What is the type of the following functions - take care to include the
   necessary typeclass constraints when necessary:

```haskell
second xs = head (tail xs)

swap (x,y) = (y,x)

pair x y = (x, y)

palindrome xs = reverse xs == xs
```

1. Write down definitions that match the declared types, replacing the
   `undefined` values; it does not matter what the actual values are or what the
   functions do, as long as they are type correct:

```haskell
copy :: a -> (a, a)
copy = undefined

apply :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
apply = undefined
```
